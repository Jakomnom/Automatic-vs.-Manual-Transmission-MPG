# Motor Trend Analysis: Automatic vs. Manual Transmission MPG

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring the relationship between transmission type (automatic vs. manual) and miles per gallon (MPG) using the `mtcars` dataset. The analysis was conducted as part of a project for Motor Trend magazine.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:

1. **Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?**  
2. **Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.**  

The analysis includes:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Regression modeling  
- Model diagnostics  
- Quantification of uncertainty using confidence intervals

## Dataset

The analysis uses the `mtcars` dataset, which is included in R. This dataset contains information about 32 cars, including:

- `mpg`: Miles per gallon  
- `am`: Transmission type (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)  
- `wt`: Weight (in 1000 lbs)  
- `hp`: Horsepower  
- Other variables related to car performance and design  

For more details about the dataset, see the [R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars).
